You will receive eleven documents. Your task is to identify ALL generalizable topics within the documents that can act as top-level topics within a topic hierarchy. Output the list of existing top-level topics as identified in the document.

[Instructions]
Step 1: Determine topics mentioned in each document.
- The topic labels must be as GENERALIZABLE as possible.
- The topics must reflect a SINGLE topic instead of a combination of topics.
- The new topics must have a short general label and a topic description.
- The topics must be broad enough to accommodate future subtopics.
- The final topic list must provide comprehensive topic coverage over the entire document. Output as many topics as needed to accomplish this instruction. Each document can have multiple topics.
Step 2: Perform ONE of the following operations:
1. If there are already duplicates or relevant topics in the hierarchy, output those topics and stop here.
2. If the document contains no topic, return "None".
3. Otherwise, add your topic as a top-level topic. Stop here and output the added topic(s) list. DO NOT add any additional levels.
